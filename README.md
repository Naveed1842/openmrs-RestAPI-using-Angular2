# openmrs-RestAPI-using-Angular2
I am trying to connect with openmrs using angular 2.But I am unable to connect with it.I am running openmrs standalone on my local machine.
I just uploaded the src folder because github does not allow me to upload the whole project.I zipped the project but it size increases more than 25mb.
Just look at patient service where I am trying to connect with openmrs but didn't connect.
